Project: MONITORING AND LOGGING WITH PROMETHEUS AND GRAFANA

Overview of Monitoring and Logging with Prometheus and Grafana

1.Objective:

*Implement a monitoring and logging solution for a web application to track performance metrics, resource usage, and potential issues.

2.Key Components:

*Metrics Collection: Use Prometheus to scrape metrics from your web application. This typically involves exposing an endpoint in your application that Prometheus can query.

*Data Storage: Prometheus stores metrics data in its own time-series database.
*Visualization: Use Grafana to create dashboards that visualize the metrics collected by Prometheus, allowing for easier interpretation and analysis of application performance.

*Alerting: Set up alerting rules in Prometheus to notify you of any anomalies or issues detected in the application metrics.

3.Implementation Steps:

*Install Prometheus: Set up a Prometheus server, configure it to scrape metrics from your application, and verify that it's collecting the desired metrics.
*Expose Application Metrics: Modify your web application to expose an endpoint (typically /metrics) that provides the necessary metrics in a format compatible with Prometheus.

*Install Grafana: Set up Grafana and configure it to connect to your Prometheus data source.
*Create Dashboards: Design and implement dashboards in Grafana to visualize the collected metrics, such as request rates, error rates, latency, and resource utilization.

*Set Up Alerts: Define alerting rules in Prometheus for critical metrics, configuring notifications to be sent through your preferred channels (e.g., email, Slack).

4.Learning Outcomes:

*Understand how to instrument an application for monitoring.

*Gain experience with setting up Prometheus and configuring scraping of metrics.

*Learn to create and customize dashboards in Grafana for effective visualization.

*Develop skills in configuring alerts to proactively monitor application health.
